## Hi! I'm Olga.

I'm passionate about programming because new technologies give us new opportunities. And I want to be a part of this movement.

### Technical stack:
- python (including OOP, GUI modules, data Analysis and visualization tools, unit tests)
- basic HTML and CSS
- databases and SQL
- Java (learning process)

I can bring to the company my development and communication skills, ability to explain sophisticated concepts in simple words, fast learning, and team playing abilities.
